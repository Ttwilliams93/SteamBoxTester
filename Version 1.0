/* The steambox has two major operation modes.  The first mode is automatic.  The wire will be inserted
 *  and then the clamp will activate after a specified delay.  The steam tube will also move forwards to bring
 *  the wire into the steam zone.  The clamp will remain locked until the CO2 laser indicates it is 
 *  complete.  At this point the air wipe will turn on and the clamp will release so the user can remove the   
 *  piece of wire. During this time the release button will remain active and the user will be able to 
 *  press release at anytime to release the lock.  This button will restart
 *  the system and clear all variables.
 *  
 *  The other mode will be manual.  The user will stick the wire into the opening and the machine will clamp.
 *  The machine will remain clamped until the user presses the reset button, this will release the clamp and 
 *  move the steam back into its home position.  It will also return the unit to the state where it is ready 
 *  to grab the piece again.   This mode will ignore the CO2 laser results.
 *  Air wipe will turn off after about 2-3 seconds in both situations.
